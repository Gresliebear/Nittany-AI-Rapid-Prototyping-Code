# Nittany-AI-Rapid-Prototyping-Code

Nittany AI Rapid Prototyping &amp; Deployment Code is just a starting point for your project. You don't have to use this specific stack, however the benefits of this stack is using python libraries like for tensorflow, sci-kit learn, pandas, numpy, then getting  those technologies deployed to the cloud as soon as possible, 

Currently this Prototype is missing a mobile application stack in place of Next.JS as alternative. 


## Prerequisites
- Install Node
- Install Python
- Install Git
- Create a Google account.
- Create a Github account.
- Create a Vercel account  to Deploy Next.JS apps 
- Create a Supabase account for database.
- Install VScode 
- Add python app on VScode
- Add indent-rainbow on VScode


## The Stack

Next.JS -> Vercel 
Flask App -> Google Cloud ->
Supabase (PostgresSQL)

This stack doesn't cover database migration, & updating data in a database. Well for prototyping 

### Flask App + Python Machine Learning Code or Models

## Next.JS 

What you learn [NextJS tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router/foundations/from-javascript-to-react) is best thing over to fully leverage this front-end, its also used in industry. 
- Javascript
- React
- Web Development concepts 

Next.JS is just a React Framework

it just has set of rules to build these things behind a web application
- User Interface
- Routing
- Data Fetching 
- Rendering
- Integrations
- Infrastructure
- Performance
- Scalability
- Developer Experience
